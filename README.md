## Description

This is the Module 18 Challenge for the boot camp. The project has been built from scratch. The application allows the user to manage a database of users using mongodb. The database holds all users, thoughts, and reactions from a Social Media website. Using the api routes and insomnia the user is able to get, create, update, and delete Users and Thoughts related to the user.
